      <h2>I like Drawing</h2>
<p>Whether it is sketchnotes of talks, scribbles in everyday life, or full blown digitized assignment drawings, drawing is 
one of my favorite ways to express myself. What started with an afternoon workshop, organized by the company I work for as a software developer, 
has now become a fixed, and important, part of my life. </p>
<h2>Ok, but what are sketchnotes?</h2>
<p>Sketchnoting, or visual notetaking, combines drawings, symbols, structural elements and text. It is used for taking notes. I like to use it for taking notes of talks at conferences, but also about my travels, thoughts, or situations in daily life. I like the fact that a few simple lines can bring notes to life. </p>
